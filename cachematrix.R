## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## I use cacheSolve to actually solve the inverse matrices or just retrive from cache.
## If the inverse matrix is already solved and saved in cache, it will be returned directly from cache;
## if not, cacheSolve will solve the inverse matrices and save it in cache, 
## and could be retrieved next time when I call cachesolve.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
